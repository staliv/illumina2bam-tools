#Installation

Requires Node.js. In order to install you can use:

	git clone https://github.com/joyent/node.git
	cd node/
	git checkout v0.6.19 //for example
	./configure
	make
	make install
	
Now you have node and npm setup, continue to install illumina2bam-tools:	

	sudo npm install illumina2bam-tools -g

OR

	git clone http://github.com/staliv/illumina2bam-tools.git
	cd illumina2bam-tools
	sudo npm install . -g

This will create links in the `/usr/local/bin/` directory for the existing tools in this package. 

##Settings
	/usr/local/lib/node_modules/illumina2bam-tools/settings.json

- specify which directory contains the distributed jars from the illumina2bam project
- the scripts will automatically search for the jars by looking recursively one folder "up" from your current working directory (when invoking for example the `illumina2bam_demultiplex_wrapper`)
- the scripts will try to write to the `settings.json` file but they will fail (somewhat gracefully) as long as the scripts aren't running as a user with write permissions to the `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/illumina2bam-tools/` directory
- specify the directory where your jars are located (in the `settings.json` file) in order to speed up the process

##Usage

###Samplesheet:

- Headers in the samplesheet that have (nn) after the header name will have that id added as meta data with the corresponding value in the read group of the resulting bam.
- Lines that begin with a "#" will be dismissed.
- The ReadString accepts the values:
	1. I = Index/Barcode
	2. Y = Bases are read
	3. N = Bases are skipped
	4. J = Joker positions in the barcode, useful if one cycle is messed up and you need to mask one of the bases in the barcode and still be able to demultiplex. For example if the barcode is TCTCGCCAT and the second index in the full read of I9Y90N2,I9Y90N2 has a bad cycle in the third position this can be masked with the ReadString I9Y90N2,I2J1I6Y90N2. The full barcode in the underlying matching algorithm will then be TCTCGCCATTCJCGCCAT. Now the IndexDecoder, which is a part of the subsequent splitting process, masks the specified base before counting mismatches on the barcode and determines if the barcode is a match or not.

Example samplesheet, values are seperated by one tab:
